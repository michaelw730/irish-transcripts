# Episode 1

## Introduction

Deirbhile: 
> Hello and welcome, or as we say in Irish - `Fáilte` - I'm Deirbhile and I'll be here throughout the series which is aimed at helping you speak Irish.  Accents and dialects differ slightly throughout the country.  In this series we'll concentrate on Ulster Irish but in later programmes we'll keep you in touch with what's used elsewhere.
> 
> After today's programme, you should be able to introduce yourself and comment on such important topics as the weather.  So now's your chance to start from scratch or to refresh what you once knew.
>
> The programmes themselves will help you cope will all kinds of different situations and there is plenty of backup material.  I'll tell you about that later on. Oh and by the way, you're never to old to learn!

## Marketplace

Deirbhile: 
> We're starting off here at the marketplace.  Well first thing's first, how do we greet somebody - How are you?  `Cad é mar atá tú?`

## Conversation 1-5

Various: 
> `Cad é mar atá tú?`

Listen again [repeat Conversation 1-5]

Voiceover:
> `Cad é mar atá tú?`  How are you?

## Conversation 6

Woman: 
> `Cad é mar atá sibh?`

You probably noticed in the last instance that the question was `Cad é mar atá sibh?`. This is what you use when you greet more than one person.  Let's watch more examples  where more than one person is greeted.  Listen carefully - `Cad é mar atá sibh?`.

## Conversation 7-9

Various:
> `Cad é mar atá sibh?`

Voiceover:
> `Cad é mar atá sibh?`  How are you?  When speaking to more than one person. [repeat Irish]

So, it's `Cad e mar atá tú?` when greeting one person and `Cad é mar atá sibh?`, if you can get their attention, when greeting more than one person.  Let's watch those situations again and this time, try to figure out in advance whether it should be `Cad é mar atá tú?` or `Cad é mar atá sibh?`.

## Conversation 10

> `Cad é mar atá sibh?`

## Conversation 11

> `Cad é mar atá tú?`

## `Conversation 12

> `Cad é mar atá sibh?`

## Conversation 13

> `Cad é mar atá tú?`


Voiceover:
> `Cad é mar atá tú?`  How are you?

> `Cad é mar atá sibh?`  How are you?  When speaking to more than one person

So, it's `Cad é mar atá tú?` when greeting one person and `Cad é mar atá sibh?` when greeting more than one person and of course and if somebody asks you how you are, you need to have a reply.  Generally people are too polite to say how they really feel.  They'll either say `Go maith`, fine, or `Go maith, go raibh maith agat`, fine, thank you.

##  Conversation 14 
Woman 1: `Cad é mar atá tú?`

Deirbhile: 
> The word 'bally' comes form the Irish word `Baile` and is commonly found in place names all over this island.  `Baile` means a place where people live - home or a town and 'Now you're talking' we have our own town `An baile Mór`, Ballymore, where our hero and heroine, Séan and Deirdre, first meet.

## Conversation 20

D: `OK, Slán a mhamaí... Slán!`


Voiceover:
> `Go maith` fine or `Go maith, go raibh maith agat` - Fine, thank you.

Repeat Conversation 21

Deirbhile: 
> Now let's go back again to a situation we saw earlier and listen to the responses and to another useful new phrase `agus tú féin?`, and yourself.

Repeat Conversation 22-24

Voiceover:
> `Agus tú féin?` - And yourself.

Deirbhile: 
> Throughout the series of 'Now you're talking' we'll look at how the language and culture is woven into our lives.  Let's begin with placenames.
>
> The Irish imagination was never lacking and many place names where inspired by parts of the human body.
> 
> Belfast, which you see here behind me, is a good one to start with.  Belfast is derived from `Beal Feirste`.  `Beal` meaning mouth and `fearset???` meaning tidal crossing. `Beal Feirste`, the mouth of the tidal crossing.  Other body parts were also borrowed and appear in many place names.  `Guala` - shoulder, `cois` - foot, `ceann` - head, `droim` - back, and `tóin` - backside.  No part of the body was sacred.
> 
> * `Guala Dhudh`: Gulladuff - Co. Derry.  Black Shoulder
> * `Cois Abhann Dalla`: Cushendall - Co. Antrim.  Foot of the River Dall
> * `Ceann Mara`: Kenmare - Co. Kerry.  Head of the sea
> * `Droim Conrach`: Drumcondra - Co. Dublin.  Ridge of the path
> * `Tóin re Gaoith`: Tandragee - Co. Armagh.  Backside to the wind
> 
> Belfast was active in the early revivals of the Irish Language and Culture.  And it was in this very building, then the Belfast exchange hall, that a unique and historical event took place.  Some Belfast citizens organised the harpers gathering of 1792.  It was an attempt to preserve the music, poetry and oral traditions of the country.  The harpers, 10 in number, including 97 year old Dennis Hempsin (?), gave it their best, and their music was transcribed by Edward Bunting.  Some of the Ayres are very well known to use today, such as the Coolin (?). 
> 
> Unfortunately, Bunting's counterpart, who was supposed to record the words, never turned up.  Subsequently, Thomas Moore wrote lyrics for many of the Ayres and it's with those lyrics that the Ayres are identified today.
> 
> Let's do a quick recap on what we've learned so far.

## Conversation 25

Man: `Cad é mar atá tu?`

Woman: `Go maith.  Agus tú féin?`

Man: `Ah, go maith`

## Conversation 26

Woman 1: `Enya, Cad é mar atá tú?`

Woman 2: `Mairead, Go maith, go raibh maith agat.`

Deirbhile:
> `Cad é mar atá tú?`.  Another thing we tend to do when we meet somebody is comment on the weather.  If it's a fine day, we say `Tá lá breá ann`.  Another unfortunately popular one is `Tá drochlá ann` - it's a bad day.  The answer to either greeting is invariably, `Tá`, it is, nobody ever disagrees.  

## Conversation 27

Woman 1: `Cad é mar atá tú, Fiona?`

Woman 2: `Tá mé go maith.  Cad é mar atá tú féin?`

Woman 1: `Go maith, go raibh maith agat.  Tá lá breá ann.`

Your turn now.  You decide how to describe the weather you'll be seeing in the next few scenes.  Either `Tá lá breá ann` or `Tá drochlá ann`.

## Conversation 32

Man: `Tá sé fuar`

Woman: `Tá, cinnte`

Deirbhile:
> `Tá sé fuar`.  And before I get too cold, did you notice how some of the people who exchanged comments on the weather added a few extra words.  `Tá, cinnte` - it is surely.  `Tá sé fuar, cinnte` - it's cold, surely.  Have another look.

Deirbhile:
> And, when the weater is fine, which isn't often enough, we usually thank God. `Buíochas le Dia`.

Deirbhile:
> The word `slán` that you heard there means goodbye.  Séan asks Deirdre for `Projute an fón?` - change for the phone.  Deirdre keeps her change in a purse `sparán` which is what a Scots man wears over his kilt.  Let's watch it again.

Repeat Conversation 44

## Conversation 45

D: 'Lucky day Tuesday, today the cavalry rides in.  But be careful, it may take more than it leaves.'


Deirbhile:
> There were probably a few words in the program that you didn't understand.  Don't worry about these, we'll deal with them later on.  Next time, we'll look at ways at introducing yourself and others.  So until then `Go dtí sin, slán`.
