# Episode 2

## Introduction

Deirbhile: 
> `Haló.  Cad é mar atá tú?`  Last time we looked at some basix greetings but if you've forgotten or you missed programme one, don't worry, they'll crop up time and time again.  In this programme we'll show you how to cope with introductions, and how to ask someone's name.

## Conversation 1
Deirbhile: `Haló.  Cad é mar atá tú?`
Woman: `Go maith`
Deirbhile: `Is mise Deirbhile Ní Churraighín`
Woman: `Tá fáilte romhat. Is mise Noreen Hanlan (>?).  Fan bomaite`

Deirbhile: 'Introducing yourself in Irish is fairly simple, as you see, there isn't much to say.  All you have to do is put `Is mise` or `mise before your name.  Here are some people teeling us their names?'
